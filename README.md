VirtuaLinux
===========

A distro of GNU/Linux with 1 preinstalled application only: VirtualBox. It must be able boot on most PCs possible, so we will focus on multi architectures. That's all. VirtuaLinux. We know we need it. We know it will be on the top ten of distrowatch.com

The desktop, after the login, will present one button: Add OS. That button fires up VirtualBox.

Once an OS is added, it must be displayed neatly along with other OSs, as if it was a boot loader.
